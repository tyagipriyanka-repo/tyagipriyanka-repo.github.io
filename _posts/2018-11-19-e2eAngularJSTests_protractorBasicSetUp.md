## Protractor
### **Step 1 - Installing**

Install using the command,
`npm install protractor -g`

Protractor will be installed on your machine and ready to be run using the  _`protractor <config_file_path>`_  command.
However, executing this command will lead to an error message, as it is necessary execute commands in Protractor with a parameter. The parameter required by Protractor is the path to the Protractor config file, because to execute tests it is needed to have a config file to guide Protractor on how it should be run.
