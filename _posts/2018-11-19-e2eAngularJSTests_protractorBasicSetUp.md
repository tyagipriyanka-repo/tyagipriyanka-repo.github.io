## Protractor
### **Step 1 - Installing**

Through a simple command  _npm install protractor -g_, Protractor will be installed on your machine and ready to be run using the  _protractor_  command. However, executing this command will lead to an error message, as it is necessary execute commands in Protractor with a parameter. The parameter required by Protractor is the path to the Protractor config file, because to execute tests it is needed to have a config file to guide Protractor on how it should be run.
